Probabilistic Search-Tree-based Chess Game with Python

This is a chess game with an "AI opponent" using Python and Pygame, featuring a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient decision-making. The chess AI incorporates heuristic evaluation of board states, taking into account piece values, positional advantages, and mobility. A key innovation in this project is the incorporation of probabilistic move selection, to introduce randomness and make the AI's behavior less deterministic and more human-like.

# How to run
Requirements: Install Python3 and the following libraries: pygame, chess, time, random, math
Run in an IDE, in the terminal by changing to the files' directory and running 'python chess.py' in the terminal (Linux and MacOS) or 'Python chess.py" on Windows Command Prompt.
